description: Parabolic approximation to a surface and local eigenframe. The surface
  on the left is a second-?order approximation of a surface at the point where the
  coordinate axes are drawn. The surface has a local normal at that point which is
  related to the cross product of the two tangents of the coordinate curves that cross
  at the that point. The three direction define a coordinate system. The coordinate
  system can be translated so that the origin lies at the point where the surface
  is expanded and rotated so that the normal n coincides with the z-axis as in the
  right hand curve. (Image by Prof. W. Craig Carter.)
