Note: Users may find additional or updated materials at Professor Carter's [3.016 course Web site](http://pruffle.mit.edu/3.016).

This page presents information for two of the labs.

There will be a laboratory each week that 3.016 meets. The labs will be practical and focused on using Mathematica速 effectively. Professor Samuel Allen will assist with the labs.

There will be assigned [reading]({{< baseurl >}}/pages/readings) from the Mathematica速 help browser that comes with the software. You should always do this reading before the laboratory, or you may not be able to **finish your assignment and turn it in before the end of the laboratory in order to get credit**.  
If you stay current in the course material and do the homeworks, you should have no difficulty doing the laboratory assignments if you do the pre-assigned reading.
